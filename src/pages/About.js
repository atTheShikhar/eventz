                           Organisers can give us their event details and we handle the 
                           tickets generation/verification, attendant information, revenue, etc. for them. 
                           We believe that organisers should not be charged for 
                           events that they are organising for free. Our service only charges you 
                           for the events that are paid, free events are managed for free.

                           People can search events based on their interests and book tickets without any hassle.
                           Tickets are in the form of QR code that can be scanned at the event venue entry.
